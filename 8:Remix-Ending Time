# Section 8: Remix 
# Coding Exercise: Ending Time

# This program takes two lines of input. The first line is a "starting time" expressed in a 24-hour clock with leading zeroes, like 08:30 or 14:07. 
# The second line is a duration D in minutes. Print out what time it will be D minutes after the starting time. For example, for input
# 12:30
# 47
# the correct output would be 13:17. All times should be formatted as numbers between 00:00 and 23:59, but the time period may go over midnight. 
# For example, on input
# 23:59
# 13
# the correct output is 00:12.

while timeh >= 24:
   timeh= timeh-24
if timeh <=9:
   timeh = "0"+str(timeh)
if timem <=9:
   timem ="0"+str(timem)
